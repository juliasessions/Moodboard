          Photographs
          <br>
          These photographs are taken from my personal album of photos, all of which were photographed
          on my phone. By documenting the sometimes exciting and mostly mundane parts of my life, I've been
          able to preserve moments that would otherwise be lost. What I call moments are not specific
          memories that have been stored, but more so the stimuli that came from outside of myself,
          influencing my own consciousness. I've learned that memories are not stored in an encyclopedic
          mannor, but are rebuilt over and over as we recall them. When memories are rebuilt, pieces are
          obscured or damaged, altering the memory once each time it is recalled. However, sensations
          are better retained than a narrative sequence. I've found that through my process of curating
          and editing I took into account these sensations. Each moment I have captured is paired with another,
          in most cases, that matches or contrasts to diversify the visual experience. As a whole, the
          photosets are organised based on vaguely similar types of places and events. Altogether they act as
          my first attempt at photography and a practice in artistic photo editing.

          Curating
          <br>
          Most of the pages in each photoset are presented as pairs. To contrast, some other photosets; Them and
          Ursae, photos are presented individually. These decisions were deliberate based on the content of each Photoset
          as a whole and the subject of each photo. Photosets Structures and Organic were created first and built
          around idea of pairing photos. The pairs in these sets had colours or textures in common, some with differing
          shapes or subject matter to convey the entirety of an imagined setting. Few of these photos were taken within the
          same time and place which allowed me to create a space from them. Photosets Them and Ursae were created later,
          at which time I changed my approach to featuring individual photos. My editing changed based on whether or
          not my photos were featured in pairs. It was important for me to ensure consistency between pairs and within
          albums while also ensuring each photo had an individual form and character.

          Editing
          <br>
          My tool of choice for editing is Photoshop version 19.1.9. The bulk of my editing was focused
          towards colour correction and photo quality. I made use of the Select tool for Color Range to
          pinpoint specific colours that I felt would decide the temperature of the photo or sharpen key
          details. With the Select > Color Range tool I applied multiple Image > Adjustments to change those
          specific colours. For example, the second photo in the Them Photoset required this editing strategy.
          My goal was to sharpen the black facial carvings, bring out the lightness of the skin and darken the contours of the face with shadow.
          By colour selecting the ranges of black in the carvings I could pinpoint and darken those pixels. To exaggerate
          whites and contours in the face I played with the Exposure and Curves of the image to make more sublte changes in
          the shadows that would match the surrounding colours. Other photos required changes in Hue, Saturation
          and Color Balance to focus each photo's general colouring. Choosing specific colours to be dominant or
          subdued was an important part of my process with more colourful photos to create an aesthetic.

          Portfolio Design (Web)
          <br>
          I drew from many influences when designing this portfolio. Subject matter is king when choosing motifs
          for my design. Initially, I considered an editoiral like approach, knowing the photo heavy content and
          minimal text. The first images I researched were older issues (60s through 80s) of Vogue magazine, specifically editorials.
          The use of columns, different sized photos and text overlaying photographs are all inspired by the magazine layout.
          To translate that motif to digital media, I also researched photography portfolio layouts to supplement my design.
          I attempted to capture the magazine motif in wholesome way rather than attempting to "Frankenstien" styles together.
          I tried to use digital design elements solely to help the functionality of the webpages, without taking center stage.
          Minimal arrows, scrollbars and no animations achieve a flatter look and experience. In conjuntion with the paper-like
          design, the archetecture of the information hierarchy was dictated by the structure of a magazine. Use of scrolling is
          mimimized to mimic the feel of paging through a book. This process was the most intensive in terms of following guided
          steps as I worked through an iterative design process. Low to High fidelity prototypes were used to adjust designs over
          and over to suit my needs. Drawings, Adobe XD PDFs and prototypes were important tools during the inception stages of the
          design. As I added new Photosets, designs were slightly adjusted by resusing code from earlier pages and making small
          changes. I made sure to structure my code such that I can efficiently expand my portfolio outward. Few elements per page
          with general classes, few colours and uniform sizes allow for a simplistic format to guide future designs for additional
          pages.
